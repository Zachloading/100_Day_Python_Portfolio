# 100_Day_Python_Portfolio
This will be a repository for my 100 day coding progression. I plan to showcase all of my projects from day 1 - 100. This will eventually be used as my first portfolio for when it comes to showcasing my projects. I am still new to Github so this may be a little messy, but I plan to tweak it overtime.
